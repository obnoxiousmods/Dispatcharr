## 📖 What is Dispatcharr?

Dispatcharr (pronounced like "dispatcher") is an **open-source powerhouse** for managing IPTV streams, EPG data, and VOD content with elegance and control.\
Born from necessity and built with passion, it started as a personal project by **[OkinawaBoss](https://github.com/OkinawaBoss)** and evolved with contributions from legends like **[dekzter](https://github.com/dekzter)**, **[SergeantPanda](https://github.com/SergeantPanda)** and **Bucatini**.

> Think of Dispatcharr as the \*arr family's IPTV cousin — simple, smart, and designed for streamers who want reliability and flexibility.

## 🎯 What Can I Do With Dispatcharr?

Dispatcharr empowers you with complete IPTV control. Here are some real-world scenarios:

💡 **Consolidate Multiple IPTV Sources**\
Combine streams from multiple providers into a single interface. Manage, filter, and organize thousands of channels with ease.

📺 **Integrate with Media Centers**\
Use HDHomeRun emulation to add virtual tuners to **Plex**, **Emby**, or **Jellyfin**. They'll discover Dispatcharr as a live TV source and can record programs directly to their own DVR libraries.

📡 **Create a Personal TV Ecosystem**\
Merge live TV channels with custom EPG guides. Generate XMLTV schedules or use auto-matching to align channels with existing program data. Export as M3U, Xtream Codes API, or HDHomeRun device.

🔧 **Transcode & Optimize Streams**\
Configure output profiles with FFmpeg transcoding to optimize streams for different clients — reduce bandwidth, standardize formats, or add audio normalization.

🔐 **Centralize VPN Access**\
Run Dispatcharr through a VPN container (like Gluetun) so all streams route through a single VPN connection. Your clients access geo-blocked content without needing individual VPNs, reducing bandwidth overhead and simplifying network management.

🚀 **Monitor & Manage in Real-Time**\
Track active streams, client connections, and bandwidth usage with live statistics. Monitor buffering events and stream quality. Automatic failover keeps viewers connected when streams fail—seamlessly switching to backup sources without interruption.

👥 **Share Access Safely**\
Create multiple user accounts with granular permissions. Share streams via M3U playlists or Xtream Codes API while controlling which users access which channels, profiles, or features. Network-based access restrictions available for additional security.

🔌 **Extend with Plugins**\
Build custom integrations using Dispatcharr's robust plugin system. Automate tasks, connect to external services, or add entirely new workflows.
